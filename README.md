### Project Title - Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation
This folder provides the starter code for the "ND9991 - C2- Infrastructure as Code - Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation" project. This folder contains the following files:


#### final-project-starter.yml
Students have to write the CloudFormation code using this YAML template for building the cloud infrastructure, as required for the project. 

#### server-parameters.json
Students may use a JSON file for increasing the generic nature of the YAML code. For example, the JSON file contains a "ParameterKey" as "EnvironmentName" and "ParameterValue" as "UdacityProject". 

In YAML code, the `${EnvironmentName}` would be substituted with `UdacityProject` accordingly.

### To create stacks

1.  ./create.sh mynetworkstack ./network.yml ./network-parameters.json
2.  ./create.sh myserverstack ./servers.yml ./server-parameters.yml

## To remove stacks (reverse order)

1. ./delete.sh myserverstack
2. ./delete.sh mynetworkstack
